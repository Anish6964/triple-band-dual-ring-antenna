Every essay or paper is made up of three parts:

introduction
body
conclusion

The introduction is the first paragraph of the paper. It often begins with a general statement about the topic and ends with a more specific statement of the main idea of your paper. The purpose of the introduction is to:

let the reader know what the topic is
inform the reader about your point of view
arouse the reader's curiosity so that he or she will want to read about your topic
The body of the paper follows the introduction. It consists of a number of paragraphs in which you develop your ideas in detail.

Limit each paragraph to one main idea. (Don't try to talk about more than one idea per paragraph.)
Prove your points continually by using specific examples and quotations from your note cards.
Use transition words to ensure a smooth flow of ideas from paragraph to paragraph.
The conclusion is the last paragraph of the paper. Its purpose is to

summarize your points, leaving out specific examples
restate the main idea of the paper
