My final Year project based on antennas

❖ Triple Band Dual Ring Antenna for Wearable Applications
❖ Description: In this project our main aim is to design a Triple-band open-ring high-gain highefficiency antenna for 2.45/3.0/3.45 GHz wearable applications. The proposed antenna operates at 
2.45 GHz for Industrial Specific, and Medical (ISM) applications, 3.0 GHz for military 
applications, and 3.45 GHz for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) 
applications.
❖ Role: Team Leader
❖ Tools Used: Ansys HFSS
