# Triple-Band High-Gain Antenna for Wearable Applications

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and development of a triple-band, high-gain, high-efficiency antenna tailored for wearable applications. The antenna is optimized for operation at 2.45 GHz (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical applications), 3.0 GHz (military applications), and 3.45 GHz (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access - WiMAX). Emphasizing off-body communication, this design targets a directional radiation pattern, high gain, high efficiency, low Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), and wearer comfort.

## Antenna Design
The proposed antenna structure consists of:
- **Two Substrates**: A rigid substrate coupled with a textile substrate for flexibility and comfort.
- **Open-Ring Radiators**: Two open-ring radiators and a feeding network printed on a low-loss rigid substrate.
- **Conductive Textile**: A square conductive textile on the backside of the textile substrate to minimize SAR and act as a protective shield.

## Key Features
- **Triple-Band Operation**: Targeted frequencies at 2.45 GHz, 3.0 GHz, and 3.45 GHz.
- **Miniaturized Design**: The outer annular ring is shorted to the ground plane with a shorting pin, aiding in size reduction and antenna stability.
- **SAR Reduction**: The conductive textile backing significantly reduces electromagnetic wave exposure to the human body.
- **Compatibility Testing**: Performance verification in free-space and on phantom/human bodies.

## Tools and Simulation
- **Ansys HFSS**: The project utilizes Ansys HFSS for simulation and design validation.
